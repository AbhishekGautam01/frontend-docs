# Closures 
* Js has **lexical scoping(Static Scope)**, Every scope has access to everything else outside the scope.  
```
let i = 1;
const f = () => console.log(i); // so i becomes available to the function
```
* __Lexical Scope__: HERE you define your function, determines what variables the function have access to WHEN it gets called.In other words, it doesnâ€™t matter where and how you invoke the function, its all about where did it got declared.
* Js is mostly func programming lang so we define func in one scope and pass it to another scope in that scenario this may fail. 
* Closures are frequently used in JavaScript for object data privacy, in event handlers and callback functions, and in partial applications, currying, and other functional programming patterns.
* A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). Simple words: **Closures give you access to outer func scope from inner function.**
* In Js a closure is created every time a function is created.
* **Using closure**: define it inside another function and expose it: 
		1. return it
		2. pass it to another function. 
* __Creating Stateful function with closures__
		1. A stateful func is one which remembers about it's previous execution. 
	* __Implementing Singleton Pattern with closures__
	```
    		const LoggingService = (function() {
		    const infoMessage = 'Info: ';
		    const warningMessage = 'Warning: ';
		    const errorMessage = 'Error: ';
		    return {
		        info: function(str) {
		            console.log(`${infoMessage}${str}`);
		        },
		        warning: function(str) {
		            console.log(`${warningMessage}${str}`);
		        },
		        error: function(str) {
		            console.log(`${errorMessage}${str}`);
		        },
		    };
			})();			.
		// someOtherFile.js
		LoggingService.info('one'); // Info: one
		LoggingService.warning('two'); // Warning: two
		LoggingService.error('three'); // Error: three
    ```

	* __Higher Order function__
		1. The function which takes one or more functions as arguments and returns a func as argument
        ```
    	function rounder(places) {
    	return function(num) {
        return Number(num.toFixed(places));
		};
		}
		const rounder2 = rounder(2);
		const rounder3 = rounder(3);
		rounder2(floatingPoint); // 3.46
		rounder3(floatingPoint); // 3.457
        ```
